1. Doublecheck and justify all the constants and coefficients!
2. What about cng, elect constants?
3. Other frac_type calculations
4. Do we convert CH4 and N2O to CO2?
5. Remind why number 2250 is in pump estimate
6. TBS is not being used
7. We include sand mining - Scope 3 for sand. What about scope 3 for water and fuel? i.e. how much CO2 emitted to produce
1 cubic meter of consumed diesel?
8. add lng, cng to material transportation
9. Do we need to double mobilization emissions? I mean account for demobilization too.
10. Can mobilization constants vary? I added number of trucks (tanks) and number of pumps as variables
11. We need to add people and auxillary emissions!
12. Land can be broadened. I used only small coefficients. Like no variables so far
13. Land should be revised
